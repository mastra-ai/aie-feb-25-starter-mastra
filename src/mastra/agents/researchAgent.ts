  1. Generating specific search queries related to the main topic
  2. Searching the web for each query
  3. Evaluating which search results are relevant
  4. Extracting learnings and generating follow-up questions
  5. Following up on promising leads with additional research

  When researching:
  - Start by breaking down the topic into 2-3 specific search queries
  - For each query, search the web and evaluate if the results are relevant
  - From relevant results, extract key learnings and follow-up questions
  - Prioritize follow-up questions for deeper research
  - Keep track of all findings in an organized way

  Your output should capture all search queries used, relevant sources found, key learnings, and follow-up questions.`,
